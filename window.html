                        Vincent Van Gogh was born in Holland in 1853.
                        Before becoming a painter he was a teacher.
                        He started painting when he was twenty-seven. In 1886 he left Holland and joined his young brother Theo, who lived in Paris.
                        Finally, on Sunday 27th July 1890, in the small village Vincent Van Gogh took a gun. He .went into a cornfield and shot himself. Thirty-six hours later Van Gogh died in his brother's arms.
